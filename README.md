Nice ‚Äî the build **succeeded** üéâ You‚Äôve got a signed `.app` in `dist/LiveDepth.app`. Here‚Äôs exactly what to do next and how to hand it to other Mac users.

# 1) Quick local test

1. Open Finder ‚Üí `dist/LiveDepth.app` ‚Üí right-click ‚Üí **Open** (first run bypasses Gatekeeper).
2. When macOS asks for **Camera** permission, click **OK**.
3. Your viewer should connect to the local server and show the point cloud.

   * Keyboard: `P` pause, `S` save PNG, `F` fullscreen, `1..4` rain modes, `G/Shift+G` GLB/GLTF export, `B` build-in, `D` dissolve, `R` reset.

If the app window stays blank or quits:

* Run it from Terminal to see logs:

  ```bash
  ./dist/LiveDepth.app/Contents/MacOS/LiveDepth
  ```
* Check **System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Camera** and ensure ‚ÄúLiveDepth‚Äù is allowed.
* If you get ‚Äúaddress in use‚Äù, something is already on port 8765. Quit that app or change your server port and rebuild.

# 2) First-run model weights (important)

Your server uses `torch.hub.load("intel-isl/MiDaS", ...)`. On a *first* run, PyTorch may download the MiDaS repo/weights to `~/.cache/torch/hub`. Two options:

* **Simplest**: run the app once on a machine with internet so the weights cache populates. After that, it works offline.
* **Portable/offline**: put the MiDaS repo & weights inside your app:

  1. Pre-download MiDaS into your project (e.g. `weights/midas/‚Ä¶`) and modify your `server.py` to load locally (example):

     ```python
     REPO = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "weights", "midas")
     midas = torch.hub.load(REPO, MODEL_TYPE, source="local").to(device).eval()
     ```
  2. You already bundle `weights/` via the spec, so it‚Äôll ship inside the `.app`. Rebuild.

# 3) Share it with people

The **fastest** way: zip the app.

```bash
cd dist
zip -r LiveDepth-macOS-arm64.zip LiveDepth.app
```

Send that zip. The recipient will:

* Unzip ‚Üí right-click **Open** (first run) ‚Üí allow Camera.
* If they get ‚Äúunidentified developer‚Äù, right-click Open solves it.

# 4) Optional: reduce size

You‚Äôre pulling in a lot of PyTorch subpackages you don‚Äôt use (and torchaudio). Two easy trims:

* Exclude torchaudio (and its libsox noise) in your spec:

  ```python
  excludes=['torchaudio', 'tensorflow']
  ```

  Then rebuild.

* If you don‚Äôt use `torchvision`, remove its `collect_all()` and hidden-import entries.

# 5) Optional: proper codesigning + notarization (no ‚ÄúOpen anyway‚Äù)

If you have an Apple Developer ID:

```bash
# 5a) Ad-hoc sign (already done by PyInstaller, but you can re-sign)
codesign --force --deep --options runtime --sign - "dist/LiveDepth.app"

# 5b) Sign with your Developer ID cert
codesign --force --deep --options runtime --sign "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" dist/LiveDepth.app

# 5c) Notarize (App Store Connect creds or API key configured)
xcrun notarytool submit dist/LiveDepth.app --keychain-profile "AC_PASSWORD" --wait
xcrun stapler staple dist/LiveDepth.app
```

After stapling, users can double-click with no warnings.

# 6) Troubleshooting you might hit

* **TensorBoard warning**: harmless (`No module named 'tensorboard'`). You‚Äôre not using it.
* **Huge app size**: normal with PyTorch. Trim packages as in step 4.
* **No camera feed**: wrong webcam index ‚Äî set `WEBCAM_INDEX=0/1` in your code or add a small UI/Config file. Because double-click apps don‚Äôt read shell envs, read a `config.json` alongside `server.py` instead.
* **MPS not used**: first time PyTorch MPS warms up slowly. Logs should still say `mps: True`. If you see CPU fallback, ensure macOS ‚â• 13 and a Metal-capable Mac.

# 7) Smoke tests (quick)

* Launch, allow camera, confirm FPS in overlay.
* Hit `G` to export a `.glb` and open it in Quick Look or Blender.
* Toggle `TEST_PATTERN=1` in your code and rebuild if you want a demo without a camera.
